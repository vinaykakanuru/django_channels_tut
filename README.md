• A simple and basic Web application to know how **_channels_** work with Django.

• Go through the official documentation to understand the step-by-step code.

• Here is the link **https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/**.

• It helps you in understading how can we create **websockets**, **consumers** and **routings**.

• It helps you in understading ASGI python specification in Django and how you write your code - synchronous in a style like Django views, fully asynchronous, or a mixture of both.

• Install the dependencies using follow command

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

• Set up docker-redis container to catch in-memory backing store

```sh
$ docker run -p 6379:6379 -d redis:5
```

• Please do ⭐ the repository, if it helped you in anyway.
